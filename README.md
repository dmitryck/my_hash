=================================================

Implement of Hash functionality based on Arrays with a **hash function** sample and **collisions resolving**

Smoke
-----
```
git clone https://github.com/dmitryck/my_hash.git
cd my_hash
bundle

rspec
```

Notes
-----

This testcase was given at [Workato](https://www.workato.com/) interview during **live coding session** (stupid and useless format).

Later, i rewrote it in a normal **realworld mode** and make the code cool and compact as possible, just for fun
